Insectoid Defense
===========

<img src="http://gowengamedev.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google_play_feature_graphic.png" />

A Sci-Fi Tower Defense game for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 8.

This project serves as an excellent template for those wanting to develop cross-platform games for mobile without relying on cross-platform frameworks. It uses precompiler directives to intuitively switch between OpenGL ES and Direct3D rendering. Roughly 90% of the game is written in C++. The other 10% of the game is a reusable wrapper layer written in Java for Android, Objective-C for iOS, and C# for Windows Phone 8.
